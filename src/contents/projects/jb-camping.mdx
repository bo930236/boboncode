</blockquote>
Build the frontend using React with Chakra UI and establish a comprehensive backend
system using Node.js / Express and MongoDB. Implement frontend-backend separation
through RESTful API. Use Redux to manage the state of the frontend and use JWT to
implement user authentication and authorization.

> ## Features

Users are divided into regular consumers and store administrators. Consumers can enjoy a seamless shopping experience on the front-end website, manage their member data, and view order records. Administrators, on the other hand, can manage "Members," "Reviews," "Products," and "Orders" in the backend.
