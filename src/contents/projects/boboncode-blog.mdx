I develop the frontend of the application using TypeScript, Next.js, and Tailwind
CSS. I deploy the frontend on Vercel, ensuring seamless user experiences. For data
storage and retrieval, I utilize PostgreSQL and deploy it on Railway, ensuring a
robust and efficient database management system.

> ## Features

My blog offers a seamless experience in both English and Chinese, catering to a diverse user base. The user-friendly design includes a heart-shaped "like" button conveniently placed in each blog post, allowing users to express their appreciation for the content with a single click. To quickly find specific articles, use the search bar located at the top of the page. Furthermore, tags are available to categorize and filter both blogs and shorts, making content discovery effortless.

In addition, sharing your favorite blogs and shorts on Twitter is just a click away. Users have the flexibility to sort the content by either date or popularity, ensuring that they can access the most relevant material based on their preferences. To enhance the reading experience, I offer both dark mode and light mode themes.

Additionally, I provide a custom statistics page, allowing me to track the performance of my blogs, including views and likes. For a deeper understanding of user behavior, my website integrates with Google Analytics and Umami, enabling detailed insights into how visitors interact with the platform.
