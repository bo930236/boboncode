I develop the frontend of the application using TypeScript, Next.js, and Tailwind
CSS. I deploy the frontend on Vercel, ensuring seamless user experiences. For data
storage and retrieval, I utilize PostgreSQL and deploy it on Railway, ensuring a
robust and efficient database management system.

> ## Features

My blog offers a seamless experience in both English and Chinese, catering to a diverse audience. The user-friendly design includes a heart-shaped like button conveniently placed in the top right corner of each blog post, allowing user to express user appreciation for the content with a single click. To quickly find specific articles, use the search bar located at the top of the page, ensuring a hassle-free browsing experience. Furthermore, tags are available to categorize and filter both blogs and shorts, making content discovery effortless.

In this socially connected age, sharing user's favorite blogs and shorts on various social media platforms is just a click away. Users have the flexibility to sort the content by either date or popularity, ensuring that user can access the most relevant and engaging material based on your preferences. To enhance user reading experience, we offer both dark mode and light mode themes, accommodating various lighting conditions and personal preferences.

Additionally, our platform goes the extra mile by providing a custom statistics page, allowing me to track the performance of my blogs, including views and likes. For a deeper understanding of user behavior, our website integrates with Google Analytics and Umami, enabling detailed insights into how visitors interact with the platform. We are committed to offering a comprehensive and user-centric experience for our valued readers and contributors.
