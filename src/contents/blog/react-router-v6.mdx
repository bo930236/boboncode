## React Router DOM Different Routers

### BrowserRouter

- The most commonly used routing method.
- Allows the current location to be stored in the browser's address bar using the URL.
- Can use the browser's built-in history to stack and implement forward or backward navigation.

### HashRouter

- Uses the URL's hash as the route.
- Does not store routes in the browser's address bar, but in the hash portion of the URL.
  (Note: The official documentation strongly advises against using this and should only be used in special cases, for example, when the URL should not be sent to a server for hosting.)

### MemoryRouter

- An invisible router that does not store routes in the browser's address bar.
- Stores the route stack in internal memory.
- Very useful for testing environments.

## Using React Router v6

### Installation

Create a Vite project and install the react-router-dom package.

```bash
npm install react-router-dom
yarn add react-router-dom
```

### Creating a Router

Create a BrowserRouter router. Here, we use main.jsx as the entry point and wrap the BrowserRouter around the outermost layer of the App component.

```jsx title="main.jsx"
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom/client';
import App from './App.jsx';
import { BrowserRouter } from 'react-router-dom';
import './index.css';

ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById('root')).render(
  <BrowserRouter>
    <App /> {/* The rest of your app goes here */}
  </BrowserRouter>
);
```

In App.jsx, we use Routes and Route components to define two different routes, and each route can specify which component to render.

```jsx title="App.jsx"
import { Route, Routes } from 'react-router-dom';
import Home from './screens/Home.jsx';
import About from './screens/About.jsx';

export default function App() {
  return (
    <Routes>
      <Route path='/' element={<Home />} />
      <Route path='/about' element={<About />} />
    </Routes>
  );
}
```
